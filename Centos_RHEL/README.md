### Centos/RH successful build

Some of Centos distros are outdated, but it's pretty simple to make a clean build

Tested to work on clean CentOS Linux release 8.1.1911

[Manual page](build/README.md)


### Centos/RH system settings

It's better to optimize system variables to run node with maximum perfomance
